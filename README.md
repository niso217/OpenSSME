OpenSSME will open any GSM dial-to-open gate automatically when you approach the gate.
The application runs in the background and probes your location using cellular network. 
the application runs a background notification that allows you to shut down the service or call the closest gate.
You can configure multiple gates and see the distance and estimated time of arrival from each gate at any time. 
When configuring the gate, you can either be at the:

- gate’s location to get your exact fix, 
- search on google, 
- use the map to place the gate on it.

the application runs a sophisticated algorithm that will calculate the estimated time of arrival and adjust the GPS calls.

When configuring the settings, you can:
- Change the distance the gate opens
- enable / disable notification sound when calling the gate.
- enable / disable closing the application after calling the gate.
- social will let your contacts send you text message with the content of: "OpenSSME"
(not case sensitive) and call on your behalf to the gate
- Wi-Fi mode will help keep your battery life by stoping all background services.
- change the type of the map.

When getting to the gate activation distance it’ll switch to use GPS to get your fine location. 
When getting to the open distance, it’ll call the gate number for you. 

This is convenient for car drivers who needs to dial the gate while driving in order to open it.

the application login is using Google/Facebook Sign-In secure authentication system.
The application is free, No commercials.
